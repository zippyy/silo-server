/**
 * The requests an in-player subtitle pick turns into.
 *
 * The choice splits across two stores, along the line the contract draws. The
 * language and the on/off mode are preferences — "this show, in English,
 * always on" — so they are canonical settings written at profile_series, where
 * the manifest resolves them above a library, a device, and the profile. The
 * track index and signature are not preferences: they identify one concrete
 * track in one file, so they stay on the specialized per-series route that has
 * always held them.
 *
 * Only values the viewer actually chose become canonical rows. The keys come
 * from SERIES_SUBTITLE_SETTING_KEYS, the same list the item page's "Auto"
 * reset clears — profile_series outranks every other scope, so a row written
 * here that the reset does not know about would shadow every later choice with
 * nothing in the UI able to remove it.
 *
 * playback.show_forced_subtitles is deliberately not among them. The player
 * holds only the *resolved* value and has no control that edits it, so for a
 * viewer who never expressed a preference it is the contract default; writing
 * that back would pin the default at the top of the ladder and permanently
 * shadow the profile-scope toggle on the Subtitles settings screen. It still
 * rides along on the legacy composite row, which is keyed to a concrete track
 * selection and is not part of the canonical resolution ladder.
 *
 * Returns an empty list when the index names neither a current track nor the
 * supplied just-created inventory entry (e.g. the in-progress AI live track's
 * sentinel): persisting it would store a nonexistent track with an empty
 * language and clobber the saved preference.
